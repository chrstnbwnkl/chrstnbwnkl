### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Once a geography student interested in urban and environmental planning, I got caught up in geographical information systems and find myself developing (mostly geospatial) software these days.

I mainly enjoy working with Python, JavaScript/TypeScript and PostGIS, while currently learning C++ (\*hipsters gasping in Rust\*).
